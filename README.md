Github Authentication and how what methods are available to be implemented

To keep our account secure, we must authenticate before we can access certain resources on GitHub. 
When we authenticate to GitHub, we supply or confirm credentials that are unique to us to prove that 
we are exactly who we declare to be.

We can access our resources in GitHub in a variety of ways: in the browser, 
via GitHub Desktop or another desktop application, with the API, 
or via the command line. Each way of accessing GitHub supports different modes of authentication.
These methods include:

Personal access tokens: Personal access tokens (PATs) are the most common method of authentication. 
A PAT is a string of characters that identifies a user and provides access to specific resources on GitHub. 
PATs can be created and revoked by the user, making them an effective method for controlling access to 
GitHub resources.

OAuth Apps: GitHub also supports OAuth 2.0, which allows users to authorize third-party applications to 
access their GitHub resources. OAuth Apps can be public or private and require users to authenticate 
with their GitHub credentials to authorize access to their resources.

SSH keys: GitHub also supports SSH keys as an authentication method. 
SSH keys allow users to connect securely to GitHub and perform actions like cloning repositories or 
pushing code changes.

GitHub Actions: GitHub Actions is a feature that allows users to automate workflows on GitHub. 
To access this feature, users must authenticate with their GitHub credentials.

SAML Single Sign-On (SSO): GitHub also supports SAML-based SSO. 
This method allows users to authenticate with their organization's identity provider to access 
GitHub resources.

Overall, GitHub provides a range of authentication methods to ensure secure access to its resources. 
Developers can choose the method that best fits their needs and integrate it into their workflow.
